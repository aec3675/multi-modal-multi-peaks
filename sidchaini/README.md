# Supernova Spectroscopy Analysis Pipeline

This directory contains my reimplementation of the WISeREP download for comprehensive analysis of supernova spectra.

## Directory Structure

### 0. example of spectra - sdss/
Contains example SDSS spectra and notebooks demonstrating how to work with FITS files using AstroPy. This is a reference for myself to see the SDSS spectral format.

### 1. Download ALL WISe data
Scripts and notebooks for systematically downloading supernova spectra from the WISeREP repository. 
- `wiserep_downloader.py`: Downloads all spectra.

### 2. Read and make single dataset
This directory will contain scripts for combining and standardizing the SDSS and WISeREP data into a single big dataset (`tensors`).

## Updates / Changelog
While creating this dataset, I decided to keep a log of every single thing I've done, to maintain reproducibility.
- **2025-03-10**: 
    - Downloaded all spectra and zip files by running script in `1. download ALL wise data`. 
    - Once downloaded, I consolidated everything into a single header file `wiserep_spectra_combined.csv` and a `spectra.tar.gz`. 
    - I also uploaded a backup to Google Drive: [URL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vnei8ACiY5gjRboYTPTQN2t569oPIRDi?usp=sharing)
    - Tried using [DVC](https://dvc.org/) to keep track of dataset, but couldn't get GDrive to work due to UD restrictions.
- **2025-03-11**: 
    - Decided to try using Kaggle to host the dataset. Uploaded `wiserep_spectra_combined.csv` and `spectra.tar.gz` to Kaggle, but ran into an error due to the presence of the char ':' in spectra filenames.
    - Manually cleaned and changed the error-causing ':' to a '_'. (e.g. `mv CSS161010:045834-081803_2457679.64_NOT_ALFOSC_None.txt CSS161010_045834-081803_2457679.64_NOT_ALFOSC_None.txt`)
    - While doing this, I decided to run a check on the filenames in `1.2. check_dataset.ipynb` and found out that there were some files referenced in `wiserep_spectra_combined.csv` but not present in `spectra/` (after extracting `spectra.tar.gz`). So, I found out what files were missing, and manually downloaded them from WISe.
    - After fixing these changes, I finally uploaded the dataset to Kaggle successfully: [Version 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthchaini/snwise-spectra) ([PUBLIC URL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/d07a362cc11e1dc441a7ae52fc0e6650c9a78ead744a62d993b512b156a98dcb/))
